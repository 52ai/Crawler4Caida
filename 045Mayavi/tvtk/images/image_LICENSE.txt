masonry.jpg:
    The image masonry.jpg is part of the VTK data (used for regression
    testing and is openly available), it is actually distributed as
    masonry.bmp, which Prabhu converted to masonry.jpg to save some disk
    space.  No license is advertised for this image in particular,
    however VTK code is under a BSD like license.  We therefore consider
    this image to have a BSD like license as well.
