# @loaders.gl/terrain

[loaders.gl](https://loaders.gl/docs) is a collection of framework-independent 3D and geospatial parsers and encoders.

This module reconstructs mesh surfaces from height map images, e.g. [Mapzen Terrain Tiles](https://github.com/tilezen/joerd/blob/master/docs/formats.md), which encodes elevation into R,G,B values.

For documentation please visit the [website](https://loaders.gl).

`@loaders.gl/terrain` uses [MARTINI](https://github.com/mapbox/martini) for mesh reconstruction.
