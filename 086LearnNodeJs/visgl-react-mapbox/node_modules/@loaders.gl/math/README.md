# @loaders.gl/math (Experimental, Temporary)

[loaders.gl](https://loaders.gl/docs) is a collection of framework-independent 3D and geospatial parsers and encoders.

This module contains math utilities for the `@loaders.gl3d-tiles` module. As they mature, these will likely be moved to a math framework (e.g. math.gl).

This code is a fork of a subset of the Cesium math library whcih is Apache 2 licensed.
