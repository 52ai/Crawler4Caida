# Map of reddit

This code renders a [map of reddit](http://anvaka.github.io/map-of-reddit/). Each dot on the map
is subreddit. Two dots within the same cluster are usually close to each other if multiple 
users frequently leave comments on both subreddits.

## How is it made?

I processed `176,178,986` unique comments that redditors left in years 2020 - 2021 and computed
Jaccard Similarity between subreddits. 

Then I treated relationships between subreddits as  a graph clustering problem. Once clusters
are computed, I treated them as a graph layout problem and created an SVG file. Once SVG file 
was created I treated it as a dual problem of WebGL rendering and streaming SVG parsing, and
created my own webgl renderer and streaming svg parser. 

Along the way I strived for simplicity. I wanted to let people edit the SVG file, correct it,
and contribute to the development of the map. And I'm happy to say that it is possible to edit 
the map via [anvaka/map-of-reddit-data](https://github.com/anvaka/map-of-reddit-data).

There is a lot of things that I'd love to improve. But I want to know that this effort is not
in vain. If you enjoy the work - please consider supporting it on [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/anvaka)

## Some notes

* There is no single "right" way to cluster reddit. Communities are very rich and they interact with
each other on multiple dimensions. Please don't treat proximity of some countries or even subreddits
within the same country as a strong proof of relationship - they could be just an artifact of my 
clustering/layout algorithm.
* It was very hard to develop the website as frequently I got side-tracked by all the amazing content
people produce on reddit.
* The algorithm decided to group multi-millionaire subreddits in one cluster. One possible way to 
de-noise such cluster is to click on "Show Related" from the sidebar. This gives focused view on the
first and second degree connections.
